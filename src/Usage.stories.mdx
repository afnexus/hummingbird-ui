# Usage of HummingBird UI v1.0
Hummingbird UI was created for both designers and developers in mind. 

Our design system includes:
- [Figma UI Kit](#figma-ui-kit)
- [Framer UI Kit](#framer-ui-kit)
- [React Component Library](#react-component-library) based on MUI

## For Designers
### Figma UI Kit
Duplicate our [UI kit on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105337376116959518) and begin using our components!

### Framer UI Kit
Our Framer UI Kit is still pending, so do look out for it!

## For Developers

### React Component Library

#### Install MUI
Our React Component Library is based on [MUI](https://mui.com/), a fully-loaded component library. To utilize our component library, you would first have to install MUI.

You can either follow the [installation instructions on MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/), or follow the instructions below.

To install and save in your `package.json` dependencies, run the commands below.

Using <b>npm</b>:
```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
Or <b>yarn</b>:

```bash
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

#### Install Hummingbird UI

#### Set MUI Custom Theme
To use our preset MUI themes, you need to use the `ThemeProvider` and `CssBaseline ` components in order to inject a theme into your application.

First, import the the `ThemeProvider` and `CssBaseline ` components from MUI.
```js
import { ThemeProvider, CssBaseline } from '@mui/material';
```
We have both light and dark themes available that you can check out in <b>Styles/Colors</b>. 

To use the <b>light theme</b> as a global style, put the following in your `App.js` file:
```js
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
      <CssBaseline />

      {/* Your code goes here */}

    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Use MUI Components
Now all the MUI components that you use throughout your app will be styled according to Hummingbird UI!

You can use any of the components in the MUI library as demonstrated in their [official documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/), and all of them will be stylized according to Hummingbird UI's preset themes.
